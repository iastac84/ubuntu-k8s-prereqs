# ansible-rpi 0.8.0

## Purpose

Make Raspberry Pi up and running in a few command.

Tested on a Rpi 3 B+ and a Rpi 1 B.

## Roles

### `common` role

> Setup the Rpi with with updates and better security

- Locale setup
- System upgrade (*including kernel*)
- Adding some useful packages (*curl, vim, tmux, git…*)
- UFW firewall rules allowing user-specified ports and protocols
- Logwatch for system status emails (*via SSMTP*)
- SSH with key-only authentification
- Custom sudo user for rpi (*thus disabling pi as Rpi sudoer*)
- `oh-my-zsh` install and vim as default editor
- Dynamic network folder and local drive setup (*Works with SAMBA and include basic credentials management*)
- Fail2Ban configuration to send mail via SSMTP, handle a custom SSH port and
  some user-defined services
- Optional hostname update and Zeroconf
- Optional custom SSH banner
- Optional Wifi config
- Optional Mosh support
- Optional unsudo of the pi user
- Optionally add a list of user to the sudoers with NOPASSWD

### `download_server` role

> Turn the Rpi in a download server for ddl and torrents

- Aria2 daemon
- RPC interface for remote monitoring with optional SSL encryption
- Shared downloads directory (*may be replaced by a previously configured network folder*)

### `media_center` role

> Turn your Raspberry into a decent customizable media center

- Kodi basic installation with separate user
- Dynamic sources creation (*may be linked to previously configured network folders*)
- Buffer handling optimized for a Raspberry
- Optional `kodi` user with `kodi-standalone` and a minimal Openbox setup
- Optional [Tvheadend](https://tvheadend.org/) install with basic config

### `rpi_docker` role

> Setup and enable control of a distant Raspberry Pi Docker host via Ansible

- [HypriotOS](https://blog.hypriot.com/) oriented setup
- Docker containers and deamon are behind the firewall by default (*see Docker Support for more infos*)
- Ansible tools are setup (*allowing you to use docker_container, docker_image Ansible modules…*)

### `unbound` role

> Transform your Raspberry Pi into a DNS Server

- Unbound setup & configuration
- Add DNS entries
- Generation of DNS entries from ansible inventory (A entries and reverse)
- Forward to another DNS
- IPv4 only for reverse

*Note: Source code is in a [separate role](https://github.com/davidderus/ansible-role-unbound).*

### `audio_center` role

> Turns your Raspberry into a Spotify player

**This role requires a PREMIUM Spotify account**

- Setup an headless Spotify Connect client ([librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot))
- Update audio config

## Setup

### With examples

```
# First
cp hosts.inc /etc/ansible/hosts

# Then
cp playbook.yml.inc playbook.yml
cp variables.yml.inc /etc/ansible/host_vars/my-host.yml
```

### Usage

First update the `hosts` file to target your Rpis.

I recommend using an up-to-date [Raspbian Lite image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest).

Make sure that the Rpi is SSHable (**latest raspbian lite images come with SSH
disabled by default, creating a file with name "ssh" in boot partition is
required to enable it.**).

Then the first time run:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -u pi --ask-pass
```

**You can also store user name in inventory file and user's pass in your Ansible
vault.**

### Dev with Vagrant

First run:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.dev
```

Next runs:

```shell
# Editing the hosts file may be required to update the SSH port
# A vagrant reload may also be needed
# Checks access with
ansible all -m ping -u neo

# Execute updated playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -u neo --ask-become-pass
```

**You can also store user name in inventory file and user's pass in your Ansible
vault.**

## User password generation

`password_hash` is a useful Jinja filter but uses 656000 rounds for SHA512 hashing.

The default is 5000 in glibc [1], and it adds an important computing cost on a Rpi.

This may cause axtra slowness on user authentification (*ie. sudo password prompt*)

Please use the following command to generate a user password hash [2]:

```shell
python -c "from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; import getpass; print sha512_crypt.encrypt(getpass.getpass(), rounds=5000)"
```

## Docker Support

In order to ease Docker handling on Rpi, I recommend the
[HypriotOS image](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/).

### Current state

The `rpi_docker` role is tested with it, but may work with other setups.

Modify the following vars in order to adapt to your device:

```yml
rd_limit_nofile: 1048576
rd_limit_nproc: 1048576
rd_limit_core: infinity
```

### Security

The `common` role will secure the HypriotOS Rpi in a way that by default:

- `docker-machine create` will **fail**
  (_default user must have a NOPASSD sudo, see [](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/generic/#/sudo-privileges)_)
- Docker daemon tcp port (_2376_) will be unreachable (_however you can enable it manually in allowed_ports var_) but is started by default
- Docker unix socket is accessible

You may want to look to [this](https://github.com/DieterReuter/arm-docker-fixes/tree/master/001-fix-docker-machine-1.8.0-create-for-arm)
for a manual `docker-machine` setup.

Docker-machine and Raspbian Docker support may come in a future release.

### Defaults

- `storage_driver` is `overlay`
- The `tlsverify` flag is enabled, and `tlscacert`, `tlscert`, `tlskey`
- `LimitNOFILE` and `LimitNPROC` are set, but `LimitCORE` is not
- iptables addition by Docker are deactivated
